# Data from:
# On the impact of security vulnerabilities in the npm package dependency network
# Alexandre Decan and Tom Mens and Eleni Constantinou
#
# Data obtained by executing the first 178 lines of Vulnerabilities.py
# (nbconvert of original Vulnerabilities.ipynb) followed by the assignment to
# kmp_df at line 1428 (not the one at 1533), followed by kmp_df.to_csv(...).
# Removing the divide by 30 (days to months) causes odd things to happen,
# which I did not track down.  So column output was multiplied by 30; also
# the first (unused) column was deleted.
# 
# Example from:
# Evidence-based Software Engineering: based on the publicly available data
# Derek M. Jones
